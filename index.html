         <p>We have all fantastized about packing up and going abroad. The people...the food...the energy.
            I have always dreamt of living abroad but have always been restrained (yes, restrained) to "brick-and-motors."
            Enter web development. 
            <br>
            This is my chance to pivot.
            <br>
            This is my ticket to freedom.</p>

      <h2>Italy</h2>

      <p>Italy has a soft spot with me. A decade ago I did a road trip through Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy.
         You ever go to a friend's house and immediately felt comfortable? That's italy for me.
         The people are a beautiful blend of the hustle of the city and the rural "cannot be bothered to hurry." No matter what
         the scene, you are family. This is my first stop for an extended stay.

      <h2>Scotland</h2>

      <p>My family is heavily Scottish and Welsh. I was brought up hearing stories about my family's history in the MacLain clan which
         includes a castle residence, owning the Hope Diamond and wars with rival clans. All of the peeks into other's travel to Scotland
         has left me with the conclusion that the people of Scotland are absolutely THE LOVELIEST. The gloomy weather is my most preferred
         weather conditions and the idyllic rolling hills of Scotland...swoon.

      <h2>Costa Rica</h2>
      <figure>
         <img src="/Images/Conchal-Beach.jpeg" alt="Beautiful beaches of Costa Rica" width="500" height="600">
      <figcaption = "The beautiful beaches of Costa Rica"></figcaption>   
      </figure>
      <p>Costa Rica is my wildcard. 
         Costa Rica is the place that will put me most out of my element. With so many opportunities for adventure (those that the beach, jungle and volcanoes afford), it
         would be remiss for me to not participate. So I must.
         Cost Rica is for my character development.

         <p>There are so many more that I could include. 
            For now, this list shall suffice as an rough outline until travel traction is established.
